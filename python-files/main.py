"""
This script helps you organize and copy PDF invoices into neatly named folders based on client codes and invoice dates. 
Here's how it works:

1. It prompts you to select one or more PDF files.
2. It extracts the client code and invoice date from each file's text.
3. It creates a folder named using the extracted details (e.g., "ABC - Invoices - March 20, 2024").
4. It copies each PDF into its corresponding folder.
5. If the script can't extract the necessary details, it places the file in an "Error" folder.
6. After processing all selected files, it lets you know it's done!

It's a simple and efficient way to keep your invoices organized. Happy sorting! ðŸš€
