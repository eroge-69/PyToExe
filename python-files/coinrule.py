Don't advertise your discord server (plainly posting an invite counts). Don't advertise your social media. Don't tell people to message you to get a link. Don't tell people you are looking for staff members. Violating this is an easy way to get a permanent ban.

**2. No harassment**

Don't go out of your way to annoy someone. If you act weird towards someone, and they tell you to stop it, you should do so.

**3. Be respectful**

We are all people here, and we don't expect you to write a formal letter for every message, however being disrespectful won't be accepted.

**4. Don't attempt to evade punishments**

This includes alts or messaging other people to say something on your behalf, or anything else that allows you to get past your punishment. This is another easy way to get a permanent ban.

**6. Don't cause drama**

If you have a personal conflict with someone, talk it out in DMs. If someone broke a rule, you are free to message a moderator about it.

**7. Don't challenge mod actions**

If you think a moderator is being unjust, you can ask them on their reasoning, but you shouldn't cause drama or be disrespectful. If you are sure they are being unreasonable, you can message a superior staff member about it, but don't just start screaming in the chat or in DMs.

**8. Use common sense**

Just because it isn't in the rules does not mean you are free to do it. If you are unsure if something is allowed, message a moderator. If you are told to stop doing something, stop it.

**9. Follow ToS**

This includes our own ToS and Discord's ToS and any other applicable document.

```
Moderators reserve the right to take action on any behavior deemed disruptive, even if not explicitly listed here.
